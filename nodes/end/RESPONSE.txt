I think the only correct way is to have only one res port.

And then fully describe the res object.

However the user interface should reflect this.

Within .fbp it's already possible to just do, e.g:

 END res [status] ->

Within the UI if a port is more thoroughly described it should
be visible. This eliminates the problem of have 30+ ports.
You then just connect to a few properties of the output on a port.

Besides that you'll have a full schema belonging to the output,
which can then also be used to do extra checks, for example
on the receiving part. (Does this property type match the receivers type)

Anyway, this is not yet how this nodule is written.
